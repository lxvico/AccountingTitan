- Create pillar/hub pages for each major topic (e.g., Journal Entries Hub, Taxation Hub, M&A Hub) that internally link to related detailed articles.
- Ensure each new article targets one primary keyword, includes a concise meta description, clear H2/H3 structure, examples, and internal links to at least 3–5 related posts.
